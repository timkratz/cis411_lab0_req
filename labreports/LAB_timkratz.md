## 2. Requirements
### Business:
  - There must be enough staff to be able to deliver the food so that it gets there within a reasonable timeframe of 15-30 minutes (Josh)

### User:
- The user must be able to be identified with their order when it is brought into the classroom to ensure that the food is given to the right person. This must be done using unique order codes that the customer gets after ordering and when the food arrives they show this code to ensure a match. (Will)

### Functional:
- The system must be able to give an estimated time of when your food will be delivered and also must give updates on when the food is leaving the on-campus provider and when it has arrived and been given to the customer. (Joel)

### Non-Functional:
- The system should be able to have the capacity for every Messiah account to be logged into the system at one time (Joel)

### System: 
- The system must be easy to navigate and only be accessible to Messiah accounts. (Josh)
- The system must be able to limit orders so that they can only be delivered on campus and to a classroom (Will)




## 3. Assumptions
 - Messiah allows this service to be used
 - Users will want to use this service
